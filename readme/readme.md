The dataset consists of 170 images, with 150 images used for training and 20 images used for validation. The Mask-RCNN model is trained on the training data, and both mAP and mAR values are displayed simultaneously. In this project, objects are segmented and boxes are drawn for their detection. Additionally, a symbol is given to the model, and you can see its results at the end of the code. The classifier part and proposal box part should be change.
