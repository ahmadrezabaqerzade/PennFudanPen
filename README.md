<h2>Train PennFudanPen dataset with Mask-RCNN:</h2>
<h3>In this project i train a dataset for detection and segmentation and you can see the result is very good.This project is a detection and segmentation task as i say that use Mask-RCNN for train dataset.Some paramters in Mask-RCNN should be change that you will see in project.</h3>
